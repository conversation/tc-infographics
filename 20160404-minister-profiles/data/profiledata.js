                "analysis": "<p>When Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott many voters believed, or at least hoped, his ascension would mean federal politics became less nasty, more positive. Turnbull by nature is upbeat and optimistic, his style lighter and more appealing than that of his predecessor.</p><p>Half a year in, judgements about Turnbull have become equivocal. Politics may not quite have reverted to the Abbott era, but it is fractious. Turnbull's campaign against Labor's tax policy is a textbook scare.</p><p>Turnbull promised to restore cabinet government and has done so to a reasonable extent. But he's lost three ministers to scandals, one of whom (Mal Brough) he should never have put on the frontbench, knowing that he was under police investigation.</p><p>Most seriously, the formulation of government tax policy has become shambolic. When he aborted the idea of a rise in the GST funding big income tax cuts, Turnbull abandoned mega reform.</p><p>This left the prospect of a tax package of limited scope. But crafting even that has proved difficult, what with technical issues and backbenchers weighing into the debate against prospective reforms they dislike or fear electorally.</p><p>One problem for Turnbull is that his treasurer, Scott Morrison, has not so far proved up to the task of carrying the tax debate. Turnbull had to rein in Morrison over the GST; there is tension between the two.</p><p>Turnbull's motifs include his commitments to innovation and 'agility'. They infuse all policy areas.</p><p>His first major policy was his innovation statement, well received despite being, when examined closely, a modest affair. The recently released defence white paper, a weighty, highly detailed piece of work, in draft form under Abbott, was 'Turnbullised' to reflect the agility-innovation vibe.</p><p>In his quest for the leadership – and afterwards in the Coalition agreement – Turnbull had to agree not to follow his preferences on issues including marriage equality and climate change. He had criticised Abbott's promise of a plebiscite on same-sex marriage, but then committed to it. He is a known critic of the Direct Action climate policy, but pledged to stick to it.</p><p>Turnbull's ability to be himself is further reduced by the willingness of the Liberal Party conservatives to act as a vigilante squad.</p><p>Turnbull is at core a pragmatist. If he must compromise on his beliefs for some other end he will do so. Nevertheless, there is a 'real Malcolm'. If he wins the election with a reasonable majority we can expect to see a lot more of that Malcolm. With his own electoral mandate, he would be less inhibited – which might turn out well or badly.</p><p>- Michelle Grattan</p>"

                "analysis": "<p>Politically, Morrison came to his Treasury post with one distinct advantage – his predecessor, Joe Hockey, had been considered an abject failure. Hockey was weighed down by the burden of his gung-ho 2014 budget; he was gaffe-prone and his communication skills were poor.</p><p>Morrison was expected to carry the government's economic narrative a great deal better. But so far he has not lived up to those expectations.</p><p>The big issue confronting him has been the tax package. Initially, the approach he and Malcolm Turnbull took – keeping all options on the table – came across as enlightened, a breath of fresh air, which won praise from lobby groups and commentators.</p><p>After a few months, however, the sourness set in. Morrison was much attracted to the option of a tax package that would change the tax mix – a rise in the GST financing substantial income tax cuts to address bracket creep, which he sees as a major drag that stifles incentive. But Morrison got too far ahead of his leader. When the modelling came in, Turnbull did not believe the (doubtful) economic gain of a GST increase was worth the political risk.</p><p>Suddenly Morrison had lost the cause on which he had hoped to build his reputation as a brave reformer. He was left with the unenviable job of defending a retreat from a politically bold policy that had never reached birth. To make matters worse, the tensions between Turnbull and Morrison became obvious and widely remarked.</p><p>While his promotion to treasurer made him a winner from the change of prime minister, Morrison also lost some political skin in the process. Tony Abbott and his supporters questioned Morrison’s loyalty to the former leader.</p><p>Morrison, who in ideological terms has been something of a chameleon over the years, had drawn close to the Liberal Party's conservatives in the Abbott days and was seen as a future leader. His lacklustre performance as treasurer has given that perception a knock.</p><p>What do we know about his vision for how the country's economy should be run?</p><p>First, Morrison <a href=\"http://sjm.ministers.treasury.gov.au/transcript/020-2016\" target='_blank'>has pointed out</a> that complex problems require complex solutions and, as a result, there is no easy way out. Second, the government’s announced approach is to reduce expenditure rather than increase taxes, although opportunities for the tax-mix switch have been passed up and reform now looks like it will centre on superannuation and company tax cuts.</p><p>A key difficulty is that the message that tax reform is complex seems contrary to the approach by the Abbott government of conveying policy ideas in simple slogans. The Abbott government’s approach may have created the expectation that there are magic bullets, and this creates a risk that voters may interpret the message that tax reform is complex as a synonym for a lack of ideas.</p><p>The challenge for Morrison is to overcome such risk by putting forward a coherent set of policy proposals on the taxation of corporations and individuals, and on the welfare and transfer system, that while not increasing the tax burden, will promote economic growth and will not adversely impact the most vulnerable members of society.</p><p>A related challenge is to articulate a long-term path to reduce the deficit simply by reducing expenditures without an impact on services or welfare payments.  Intuitively many voters will expect that expenditures will continue to be high to meet the increasing costs associated with an ageing population (health care, aged care and the pension), education and to satisfy other societal needs such as the NDIS or the NBN.</p><p>The longer-term assessment of Morrison will depend on the tax decisions, and his first budget, to be delivered on May 3, as well as his performance in and beyond the election, assuming the Turnbull government is returned. In the Treasury portfolio, what is crucial is the ability to learn and grow, as the experiences of John Howard in the Fraser government and Paul Keating in the Hawke government attest.</p><p>- Michelle Grattan and Flavio Menezes</p>"

But since Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister and Pyne moved into the science portfolio, much has been done to fix this damage and, in part, set a viable path for science in Australia into the future. Though there remain challenges, the scientific sector can see in the current government a political leadership that, if not an unwavering friend, at least appears to value the role of science in society.</p><p>The centrepiece of the government’s approach to science is framed in the <a href=\"http://www.innovation.gov.au/page/agenda\" target='_blank'>National Innovation and Science Agenda</a> (NISA), a package of investments and reforms unveiled in December 2015 aimed at stimulating a closer relationship between science and industry in Australia, and a deeper enmeshment of science in the economy.</p><p>Though this echoes the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/an-invisible-odourless-weightless-science-minister-for-australia-18250\" target='_blank'>efforts</a> of previous science minister Ian Macfarlane, it is common at the moment to hear observers note that we now have a prime minister who \"gets it\".</p><p>As part of NISA, Pyne has put some of Australia’s key scientific infrastructure on a more stable footing, which is critical for planning scientific work that cannot fit into three-year political cycles. Here the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy has gone from an uncertain future in 2014 to a stable funding platform <a href=\"http://innovation.gov.au/factsheets/building-world-class-national-research-infrastructure\" target='_blank'>for the next decade</a>, and the Australian Synchrotron has <a href=\"http://innovation.gov.au/event/bright-future-secured-australian-synchrotron\" target='_blank'>moved to a more predictable operating environment</a>, coming under the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation umbrella and gaining international funding from New Zealand.</p><p>There remain key challenges for Pyne in the scientific sector. CSIRO leadership has seen significant criticism for <a href=\"http://cpsu-csiro.org.au/campaigns/csiro-restructure/\" target='_blank'>recent restructures</a>, in particular reducing its climate monitoring capacity.</p><p>Similarly, though NISA has broad support among the scientific sector, getting the balance right between curiosity-driven and applied research – and how we set the policy levers to achieve this balance in our range of scientific organisations and funding bodies – will always remain a tension. Here the government would do well to engage with the scientific sector, but so too we in the scientific sector must continue to grapple with our responsibilities to society.</p><p>–  Will Grant</p>"

He persevered in pushing for regulations to negate these key reforms, which would have effectively allowed the reintroduction of conflicted sales payments, and in the face of a damning Senate report into the Commonwealth Bank financial planning scandal.</p><p>The rollback was defeated by the crossbench, but not before Cormann announced that if the Senate knocked back his initiative he would be going after industry super funds, which he claimed enjoyed a \"special deal\" by being exempt from opt-in and fee disclosure provisions under FoFA. The special deal was a misunderstanding about an exemption for intra-fund advice, enjoyed equally by industry and retail super funds.</p><p>With the 2016 budget looming and the tax review underway, Cormann will be under close scrutiny. His input to these agendas is critical, especially with regard to superannuation and financial services. The current inertia from the government and lack of decisive leadership regarding tax policy presents a challenge to achieving a good outcome.</p><p>- Deborah Ralston</p>"

He described it as \"the key to unlocking opportunity\" for the disadvantaged.</p><p>In the speech, he floated a number of staunchly market-based agendas for schools, such as <a href='http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/school-choice-vouchers.aspx' target='_blank'>school vouchers</a> to increase parental choice and <a href='http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisainfocus/50328990.pdf' target='_blank'>performance-based pay</a> for teachers. He also praised efforts by the then-Howard government to inspire enrolment shifts from \"overly bureaucratised\" public schools to more \"responsive\" private schools.</p><p>Birmingham has shown little desire, however, to pursue any radical reform options since taking the helm from his predecessor Christopher Pyne. Instead, he has chosen to reaffirm the fundamentals of the <a href='https://www.studentsfirst.gov.au' target='_blank'>Students First</a> policy agenda established during the Abbott era, which focuses on teacher quality, curriculum reform, school autonomy, and engaging parents in education.</p><p>Birmingham has also stood firm in supporting the Coalition’s decision not to fund the final two years of the six-year Gonski school funding reforms established under the former Labor government. Birmingham recently said he would not <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/simon-birmingham-dont-expect-schools-election-cash-splash-20151227-glvlpx.html\" target='_blank'>\"shower more money on schools\"</a>, supporting Turnbull’s position that he will not engage in a <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-29/turnbull-won't-run-fistful-of-dollars-election-campaign/7123514\" target='_blank'>\"fistful of dollars\"</a> election campaign.</p><p>Perhaps the only novel aspect of Birmingham’s leadership is that he has sought to generate momentum in relation to Malcolm Turnbull's \"innovation agenda\", dedicating several new buckets of money to improving young people’s digital literacy skills and to increase the focus on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) in all levels of education.</p><p>Labor is seeking to capitalise on the Coalition’s retreat from Gonski by promising to fund the agreement’s <a href='http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labor-commits-to-fully-funding-gonski-as-part-of-election-year-education-reform-plan-20160127-gmfovf.html' target='_blank'>final two years</a> if elected.</p><p>School funding is one of the few areas left that distinguishes the two major parties in an era marked by <a href='https://theconversation.com/labors-struggle-to-remain-the-education-party-53309' target='_blank'>furious agreement</a> when it comes to schooling policy at the national level. Labor’s renewed commitment to Gonski has given it a handy wedge to use against the Coalition.</p><p>Despite arguing repeatedly that school funding is <a href='http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/simon-birmingham-dont-expect-schools-election-cash-splash-20151227-glvlpx.html' target='_blank'>not the magic bullet</a> to fix Australia’s schools, Birmingham would be unwise to ignore the emotive power of the funding debate to steer public opinion in an election year.</p><p>Birmingham has said he will negotiate a new funding deal with the states from 2018, but this is easier said than done given strong support for Gonski reform in key states. Birmingham’s battle is not only against federal Labor, but also against state Liberal counterparts such as NSW Premier Mike Baird, who has <a href='http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/nsw-schools-will-remain-under-resourced-without-full-gonski-funding-government-warns-20151229-glwepu.html' target='_blank'>pushed back</a>  against the decision to scrap the reforms.</p><p>It looks increasingly likely that the Coalition will go to the election with no viable alternative to Labor’s Gonski plan, which could damage its election chances if it wants education to be a core pillar of its campaign.</p><p>In higher education, Birmingham inherited scorched earth from Pyne. Despite having the support of virtually all the nation's vice-chancellors, the government had been unable to get its plan to deregulate university fees through the Senate.</p><p>It dumped the plan as proposed and Birmingham embarked on an extensive round of consultations with the higher education sector. In a March speech Birmingham made it clear that the government remains committed to reconsidering \"the balance between public and private contributions\" to higher education – that is, what government provides and students pay. But, as yet, Birmingham has produced no new specific policy for doing that.</p><p>– Glenn Savage and Michelle Grattan</p>"

Her calls for reform, integration and increased oversight promise a positive step towards better transparency and accountability in defence policies.</p><p>On the downside, however, some observers have criticised issues related to competitive evaluation processes as too sluggish, and too heavily overlain with government spin.</p><p>And Australia's defence budget has long been a mess. There has also been some criticism of the logic of boosting defence spending to 2% of GDP – outlined in the white paper – as too arbitrary. While Payne appears committed to keep this promise, it will still demand a sharp eye in tackling ongoing issues of waste, tendering, cost-effectiveness and delay.</p><p>There are other areas in which Payne has her work cut out. Managing the politics of naval ship-building that includes the justifications and risks behind the future submarine project remains a tricky task.

The changes have sparked some concern that this will lead to further concentration of media ownership in Australia.</p><p>The final area within communications that is going to challenge Fifield is the ABC’s triennial funding.

Shorten had the opposition stick like glue to the government, despite worries in sections of Labor about some of the tough security legislation.</p><p>He also navigated his way through the ALP national conference on the difficult issues of boats and same-sex marriage. The conference gave a future Labor government a free hand to turn back asylum seekers' boats. On same-sex marriage, the party maintained a free vote for caucus members for some time, rather than binding them to vote in favour.</p><p>Shorten came in for ridicule from the government and criticism from the media after declaring 2015 Labor's \"year of ideas\", only to have relatively few big ideas come forth initially. But by 2016 it was a different story. After the ALP produced its bold initiative to curb negative gearing and cut back the capital gains tax discount, it received praise for getting out in front on policy – even from some who took issue with the contents of its plan.</p><p>Shorten's consistent attack on the prospect of the government raising the GST fanned Coalition backbench nerves. Turnbull might say he walked away from the option only because of the modelling, but the Labor campaign had given him a technicolour glimpse of the politics.</p><p>To the extent there was a victory for Shorten here, it was double-edged: he would have greatly liked to have had a GST election campaign – just as he would have dearly wished to be running against Abbott, not Turnbull.</p><p>- Michelle Grattan</p>"

The rationale was that it would be completed more quickly and cheaply than a full fibre solution.</p><p>But the change in approach may not have been as smooth as the government would have liked. Documents have been leaked from within NBN Co. suggesting that the project is substantially behind schedule and significantly overbudget.</p><p>There have also been questions raised about the use of existing copper in the NBN. The existing copper network is in some areas very old and requires replacing. There have been some claims that the copper has been replaced – not with fibre as would be logical, but with new copper.</p><p>Clare has been able to exploit the leaks and questions surrounding the roll-out of the NBN very effectively, using them to attack Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (who was previously communications minister) on what he has described as a \"massive mess\".</p><p>Clare has said that if Labor wins government at the next election there would be a return to a full fibre-to-the-premises model.</p><p>Clare has said he supports the government’s cross-media ownership changes that will allow mergers between networks and their rural affiliates, but is much more circumspect about changes regarding ownership limitations.</p><p>– Philip Branch</p>"

He has been Labor’s employment and workplace relations spokesperson since Bill Shorten became leader, and recently added electoral matters to his portfolio after the former spokesperson, Gary Gray, <a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/30904942/gary-gray-laments-dumb-arguments-against-senate-voting-bill/\" target='_blank'>publicly criticised</a> Labor’s somewhat opportunistic position on Senate voting reform.</p><p>O’Connor has a background as a union official, but only spent a few weeks as employment minister in the final Rudd ministry.</p><p>He does not have a high profile, but the key thing for a Labor opposition spokesperson in this area to do is not to stuff up. O’Connor has been expert at that. The challenge will come when the government lays its industrial relations cards on the table, particularly in responding to the Productivity Commission’s report – about which it becomes more coy each time there is a discouraging opinion poll.</p><p>The temptation for Labor (and the unions) has been to label each snippet of insight into government policy as \"WorkChoices revisited\". Neither the Coalition’s 2013 policy nor what has come out of the Productivity Commission could be accurately described that way. This is not to say that it is better or worse – some aspects are less radical than WorkChoices, some aspects more radical. Simply, it is demonstrably different.</p><p>But as more people enter the voting population without a vivid memory of the 2005-07 campaign, and memory of WorkChoices fades, no small part of O’Connor’s challenge will be to find a way of communicating the problems with the government's plans in a way that is both resonant and persuasive.</p><p>– David Peetz</p>"
