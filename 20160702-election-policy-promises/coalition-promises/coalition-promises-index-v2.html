            <p>The Coalition's proposed changes to superannuation, which include capping concessional contributions at A$25,000 and the introduction of a $500,000 lifetime cap, <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-ghost-of-the-greedy-geezers-hovers-over-our-super-debate-60706" target='_blank'>have angered many Liberal Party supporters</a>.</p>

            <p>The proposed company tax was another strong point of debate in the campaign. But the Coalition, which will give small businesses a tax cut that would be expanded to all companies within ten years, is holding firm about its <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-full-story-on-company-tax-cuts-and-your-hip-pocket-59458" target='_blank'>long-term economic benefits</a>.</p>

            <p>The Coalition will raise the tobacco excise by 12.5% a year for four years. It has definitively ruled out any reform of negative gearing.</p>

            <p>Finally, the Coalition will bring in a "Google Tax" designed to tackle multinational companies structured to avoid tax.</p>

Interns will receive $100 per week on top of their welfare payments.</p>

            <p>The Coalition offered $49.2 million to save 2,700 South Australian jobs, matching a Labor promise.</p>

            <p>More broadly, the Coalition argues its company tax cuts will <a href="https://theconversation.com/is-small-business-really-the-engine-room-of-australias-economy-60447" target='_blank'>help create jobs and growth</a>.</p>

The Coalition campaigned strongly that Labor was at war with business.</p>
            
           <p>In the final week of the campaign, the Coalition has also announced $2.3 billion in savings through a <a href="https://theconversation.com/coalition-targets-welfare-in-2-3b-pre-election-savings-pitch-61747">welfare crackdown</a>.</p>    

            <p>As expected, the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO) released on May 20 <a href="https://theconversation.com/infographic-pefo-2016-at-a-glance-59668" target='_blank'>did not reflect any major changes</a> to Australia's economic indicators following on the federal budget on May 3. However, the optimistic nature of the underlying assumptions endorsed by Treasury – particularly around economic growth – <a href="https://theconversation.com/questioning-the-assumptions-underlying-the-pre-election-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-58996" target='_blank'>have been questioned</a>.    </p>

            <p>The secretaries of Treasury and Finance have warned it is “crucial” for Australia to <a href="https://theconversation.com/labor-seizes-on-treasury-and-finance-secretaries-warning-about-revenue-59748" target='_blank'>retain its AAA credit rating</a>, and said surpluses won’t be possible without tax rises unless there is a “considerable effort” to reduce spending growth.</p>

            <p>The Coalition has proposed a A$3 billion childcare package that aims to save families around $30 a week for those with incomes between $65,000 and $170,000. It also aims to ensure all children receive 15 hours of preschool a week in the year before school.</p>

            <p>The Coalition is offering $1.2 billion in <a href="https://theconversation.com/budget-2016-brings-temporary-solutions-for-schools-and-puts-more-demands-on-students-and-teachers-58770" target='_blank'>"needs-based" funding for schools</a> for 2018-20. But it <a href="https://theconversation.com/federal-budget-2016-education-experts-react-58592" target='_blank'>has not released details</a> about how it will determine “need”.</p>

            <p>Under the Coalition, <a href="https://theconversation.com/budget-2016-brings-temporary-solutions-for-schools-and-puts-more-demands-on-students-and-teachers-58770" target='_blank'>conditions will be placed</a> on funding for schools, which include introducing literacy and numeracy tests for students in Year 1; minimum literacy and numeracy standards for Year 12 school-leavers; and basing <a href="http://www.senatorbirmingham.com.au/Media-Centre/Media-Releases/ID/3061/The-quality-reforms-needed-to-get-all-Australian-students-ahead" target='_blank'>teachers’ pay on performance</a>. Malcolm Turnbull has also called for maths and science to be made compulsory for all students finishing high school.</p>

            <p>The Coalition has put all major reforms for higher education <a href="https://theconversation.com/higher-education-in-policy-paralysis-after-budget-2016-what-now-58815" target='_blank'>on hold</a> for at least a year. All reform ideas being considered – including <a href="https://theconversation.com/higher-education-in-policy-paralysis-after-budget-2016-what-now-58815" target='_blank'>deregulating fees</a> for some courses – have been outlined in an <a href="https://docs.education.gov.au/documents/driving-innovation-fairness-and-excellence-australian-education" target='_blank'>"options" paper</a>. But the Coalition has confirmed that the Office for Learning and Teaching <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-office-for-learning-and-teaching-and-why-does-it-matter-59079" target='_blank'>will be cut</a> – only the teaching awards would remain. And it will <a href="https://theconversation.com/higher-education-in-policy-paralysis-after-budget-2016-what-now-58815" target='_blank'>cut 22%</a> from the Higher Education Participation Program. </p>

            <p>The Coalition plans <a href="https://theconversation.com/higher-education-in-policy-paralysis-after-budget-2016-what-now-58815" target='_blank'>to reduce</a> the threshold for paying back student loans to between $40,000 and $45,000. However, it has said it would abolish HELP debt reductions for some teaching and nursing graduates.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-23/election-2016:-bill-shorten-refuses-to-repeat-medicare-claims/7538212" target='_blank'>declared</a> Australia’s universal health system, Medicare, "will never, ever be privatised".</p>

            <p>Under a <a href="https://theconversation.com/confused-about-the-medicare-rebate-freeze-heres-what-you-need-to-know-59661" target='_blank'>Coalition-run Medicare</a>, GPs will be paid the same for consultations in 2020 as they were in 2014. Pathologists and radiologists will no longer receive an incentive to bulk bill patients. If providers pass these cuts on, consumers could face lower rates of bulk-billing rates and higher co-payments. </p>

            <p>The Coalition has focused on <a href="https://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2016/06/12/coalitions-plan-ensure-private-health-insurance-delivers-value-money" target='_blank'>making private health insurance easier to navigate</a>. It will introduce reforms to simplify billing, standardise definitions for procedures, and introduce gold, silver and bronze categories of cover so consumers know what they are buying. </p>

            <p>The Coalition's A$21 million <a href="https://theconversation.com/time-for-better-chronic-disease-management-in-primary-care-57035" target='_blank'>Health Care Homes trial</a> aims to strengthen primary care to keep patients out of hospitals. But it has not funded a full roll-out, and the trial is therefore unlikely to make a difference to many Australians living with chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. </p>

            <p>The Coalition's <a href="https://theconversation.com/hospital-funding-deal-experts-respond-57122" target='_blank'>$2.9 billion pre-election hospital funding deal</a> with the states ensured public hospital waiting times and elective surgery were largely kept out of the campaign.</p>

            <p>The 26-28% cut to greenhouse emissions, <a href="https://theconversation.com/australias-2030-climate-target-puts-us-in-the-race-but-at-the-back-45931" target='_blank'>announced by Tony Abbott last year</a> ahead of the Paris climate summit, remains the Coalition's policy.</p>

            <p>It also remains committed to its A$2.55 billion <a href="https://theconversation.com/au/topics/emissions-reduction-fund" target='_blank'>Emissions Reduction Fund</a> (ERF), which offers public funding to carbon-reduction projects, despite persistent concerns that the scheme is <a href="https://theconversation.com/on-these-numbers-australias-emissions-auction-wont-get-the-job-done-40761" target='_blank'>still not ambitious enough</a> to get the job done.</p>

            <p>Carbon pricing remains anathema to the Coalition, as shown by Treasurer Scott Morrison's hailing of the <a href="https://theconversation.com/carbon-tax-axed-how-it-affects-you-australia-and-our-emissions-28895" target='_blank'>carbon tax repeal</a> in a budget speech that otherwise <a href="https://theconversation.com/budget-repair-climate-risks-and-global-concerns-all-ignored-in-this-conflicted-effort-58853" target='_blank'>steered well clear of climate issues</a>. Yet the ERF could be <a href="https://theconversation.com/australias-new-cap-on-emissions-is-a-trading-scheme-in-all-but-name-47035" target='_blank'>easily tweaked to become a carbon market</a>, suggesting the biggest hurdle would be political rather than practical.</p>

            <p>The Coalition joined with the other major parties and <a href="https://theconversation.com/policycheck-what-are-the-parties-really-offering-to-save-the-great-barrier-reef-60927" target='_blank'>pledged significant funding</a> to safeguard the reef from fertiliser run-off and other environmental problems.

            <p>In 2015, the federal government cut Australia Council funding by around A$104 million to create its National Program for Excellence in the Arts (NPEA). After a widespread outcry, and a <a href="https://theconversation.com/senate-inquiry-into-arts-funding-testimony-and-truth-in-south-australia-47852" target='_blank'>Senate inquiry</a> into the impact of the arts budget cuts, it later returned $32 million to the Australia Council. It also renamed and revised the NPEA, <a href="https://theconversation.com/out-with-the-npea-in-with-catalyst-expert-response-51026" target='_blank'>establishing the Catalyst fund</a> to distribute $12 million annually in <a href="https://theconversation.com/where-is-the-balance-and-credibility-in-our-federal-governments-arts-policy-58485" target='_blank'>“innovative projects”</a>.</p>

            <p>The Turnbull government announced further cuts, in December, of $52.5 million to the arts sector over the next four years – as part of the process of increasing its “efficiency dividend”. These have <a href="https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-silver-tongued-turnbull-fails-to-woo-the-arts-vote-55132" target='_blank'>targeted national cultural institutions</a> such as the National Library of Australia, and the Australian film industry.</p>

            <p>In an open letter to Malcolm Turnbull, the federation of national peak arts organisations, Arts Peak, called on him to stem the tide of relentless funding cuts to arts groups, with <a href="https://theconversation.com/small-is-beautiful-artist-run-collectives-count-but-theyre-facing-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-52684" target='_blank'>small artist-run collectives</a> in particular facing a struggle to survive.</p>

He spoke of cities as <a href="https://theconversation.com/hopes-of-a-new-urban-age-survive-ministers-fall-52975" target='_blank'>hubs of innovation</a>, with <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-city-thrives-on-connectedness-but-access-all-hours-makes-privacy-a-problem-49999" target='_blank'>digital connectivity</a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/innovation-statement-must-reinvent-the-wheel-or-throw-it-away-51388" target='_blank'>transforming</a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/growing-challenges-are-disrupting-our-old-ways-of-getting-around-cities-50965" target='_blank'>how cities work</a>.</p>

            <p>Before having to resign, the new cities minister, Jamie Briggs, <a href="https://theconversation.com/politics-podcast-jamie-briggs-on-the-infrastructure-needs-of-australian-cities-48383" target='_blank'>advocated an ambitious infrastructure agenda</a>. However, the <a href="https://cities.dpmc.gov.au/smart-cities-plan" target='_blank'>Smart Cities Plan</a> did not feature heavily in the election campaign.</p>

            <p>Turnbull has <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-30-minute-city-how-do-we-put-the-political-rhetoric-into-practice-56136" target='_blank'>advocated 30-minute cities</a>, using <a href="https://theconversation.com/want-to-build-better-cities-get-the-private-sector-involved-in-rail-projects-52204" target='_blank'>value capture models</a> to finance public transport. Currently, most of the <a href="https://www.liberal.org.au/our-plan/building-australias-infrastructure" target='_blank'>big projects the Coalition is funding</a> are road-based, such as <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-maths-of-congestion-springs-strings-and-traffic-jams-41684" target='_blank'>WestConnex in Sydney</a> and the Monash and M80 upgrades in Melbourne. The Sydney Metro is a notable exception.</p>

            <p>The Coalition is <a href="https://theconversation.com/election-2016-will-the-infrastructure-promises-meet-australias-needs-61140" target='_blank'>committed to funding</a> WestConnex, the M1 and Ipswich Motorway upgrades in Brisbane and the Gold Coast Light Rail. In Perth, the Coalition is funding the Perth Freight Link. </p>

            <p>Turnbull and his <a href="https://theconversation.com/memo-to-our-latest-cities-minister-heres-what-needs-to-be-done-55768" target='_blank'>minister for cities and digital transformation</a>, Angus Taylor, favour <a href="https://theconversation.com/city-deals-nine-reasons-this-imported-model-of-urban-development-demands-due-diligence-57040" target='_blank'>the UK City Deals model</a> of urban development and financing. </p>

            <p>It also gave a little extra certainty to the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Scheme (<a href="https://theconversation.com/au/topics/ncris" target='_blank'>NCRIS</a>) – which funds scientific infrastructure, such as telescopes and supercomputers – with a <a href="https://theconversation.com/expert-panel-what-the-national-innovation-statement-means-for-science-51902" target='_blank'>ten-year assurance</a> of continued funding.</p>

This has sometimes compromised their ability to conduct top-tier research.</p>

            <p>Funding has also been excruciatingly tight for individual researchers. <a href="https://theconversation.com/science-funding-should-go-to-people-not-projects-44001" target='_blank'>Fewer than 15%</a> of grant applications to the National Health and Medical Research Council (<a href="https://theconversation.com/au/topics/nhmrc" target='_blank'>NHMRC</a>) are funded each year.</p>

As <a href="https://theconversation.com/major-parties-are-behind-the-times-and-strangely-silent-on-social-policy-60314" target='_blank'>Eva Cox pointed out</a>, the major parties in particular have been strangely silent on the subject.</p>

            <p>Given its expense and the widely acknowledged need for reform, it is mysterious that <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-is-childcare-such-a-hard-sell-in-the-federal-election-59815" target='_blank'>child care wasn’t a bigger issue</a> in this campaign. Both parties announced reforms, but the debate around them was noticeably flat. The Coalition will redesign the policy and replace the Child Care Rebate and Child Care Benefit with a single payment.</p>

            <p>Encouragingly, given that one in six women have experienced violence from a current or former partner, both major parties have announced policies aimed at combating family violence. For example, this year's budget <a href="https://www.liberal.org.au/our-plan/tackling-domestic-violence" target='_blank'>allocated A$100 million over three years</a> to implement the <a href="https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/women/programs-services/reducing-violence/the-national-plan-to-reduce-violence-against-women-and-their-children-2010-2022" target='_blank'>National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children 2010-2022</a> and the recommendations of the <a href="https://www.dpmc.gov.au/office-women/womens-safety/coag-advisory-panel-reducing-violence-against-women-and-their-children" target='_blank'>COAG advisory panel</a> from April 2016.</p>
