            <p>As part of its ten-year economic plan, Labor will target <a href="https://theconversation.com/labor-searches-for-savings-amid-family-benefits-reform-60858" target='_blank'>family tax benefits</a>, tightening the means test for Family Tax Benefit A and reducing the payment by 50% for families with incomes of more than $100,000. </p>

            <p>Labor will also confine negative gearing to new housing and halve the capital gains subsidy for assets bought after July 1, 2017 – from 50% to 25%. </p>

            <p>Labor's tax avoidance plan now is to focus more on tightening up the rules that regulate excessive tax-deduction claims, and improving data-matching rules to achieve better compliance.</p>

            <p>Labor hopes its ten-year economic plan will return the budget to surplus in 2020-21 – the same timing as the previous Coalition plan. But it has indicated it would allow the deficit <a href="https://theconversation.com/labor-costings-alp-deficit-16-5-billion-higher-over-the-budget-period-61643" target='_blank'>to worsen over the short term</a>.</p>

            <p>Labor's <a href="https://theconversation.com/labor-to-release-savings-package-60829" target='_blank'>savings</a> include tightening the Family Tax Benefit system and <a href="https://theconversation.com/labor-finds-16-billion-more-savings-to-put-on-the-table-60862" target='_blank'>tackling so-called "zombie" measures</a> that the Turnbull government was unable to get through the parliament.</p>

            <p>Labor has also claimed savings from rejecting the Coalition's proposed company tax cuts.</p>

            <p>During the election Labor shifted the early-years education debate from being about getting mums back to work to delivering high-quality, <a href="https://theconversation.com/high-quality-affordable-education-at-the-heart-of-labors-new-early-years-policy-60535" target='_blank'>affordable education</a>. It plans to invest <a href="https://theconversation.com/policycheck-labors-3-billion-child-care-plan-60523" target='_blank'>A$3 billion into child care</a>, lift the annual cap on the Child Care Rebate from $7,500 to $10,000 per child, and increase the Child Care Benefit by 15% starting January 1, 2017.</p>

            <p>Both parties were committed to giving extra <a href="https://theconversation.com/budget-2016-brings-temporary-solutions-for-schools-and-puts-more-demands-on-students-and-teachers-58770" target='_blank'>"needs-based" funding to schools</a>. Labor’s promise is $4.5 billion for 2018-19 as part of the <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-a-gonski-anyway-13599" target='_blank'>Gonski reform model</a>. </p>

            <p>For Labor, "needs-based" means allocating funding to <a href="https://theconversation.com/with-gonski-gone-we-can-expect-more-demand-for-private-schools-52760" target='_blank'>support disadvantaged children</a> who need it the most – which includes Indigenous children and those with disability.</p>

            <p>Strengthening teacher quality, early intervention programs in every school, increasing Year 12 completion rates to 95% by 2020, and focusing on improving STEM, coding and entrepreneurial skills are also <a href="https://theconversation.com/federal-election-2016-whats-on-the-table-for-schools-58399" target='_blank'>priorities</a>.</p>

            <p>Labor's plan is to create <a href="https://theconversation.com/is-labors-plan-to-create-ten-institutes-of-higher-education-a-good-idea-61146" target='_blank'>ten Institutes of Higher Education</a>, increase funding by $2,500 per student each year from 2018, and impose <a href="http://www.billshorten.com.au/labor_s_plan_to_stop_dodgy_providers_ripping_off_taxpayers_and_students" target='_blank'>an $8,000-a-year cap</a> on VET student loans. It also aims to boost science spending by $375 million, restore funding to <a href="https://theconversation.com/pyne-versus-carr-on-innovation-who-came-out-top-61274" target='_blank'>the CSIRO</a> and university research, and help regional universities to increase their research effort. </p>

            <p>Labor will also <a href="https://theconversation.com/labor-will-need-more-than-scholarships-to-make-teaching-science-an-attractive-career-59510" target='_blank'>spend $400 million</a> on scholarships worth $15,000 aimed at getting STEM graduates into teaching. Shadow Higher Education Minister Kim Carr also said he would establish a department of innovation.</p>

            <p>Those who take out student loans will soon have to start paying the debt back once they start earning <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/jun/10/australian-election-2016-labor-to-announce-support-for-cuts-to-family-payments-politics-live?page=with:block-575a4da3e4b01a5ff948b54c" target='_blank'>$50,638</a>, down from $54,869.

These promises are projected to cost A$2.4 billion and $884 million respectively over the next four years. </p>

            <p>Shorten has promised his government will increase hospital funding to the states by <a href="http://www.billshorten.com.au/reduced_hospital_waiting_times_better_health_for_all_australians_sunday_12_june_2016" target='_blank'>$4.9 billion</a> and will fund 50% of the growth in hospital costs. </p>
